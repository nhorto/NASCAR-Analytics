# Architecture — NASCAR Analytics

## What This Is

NASCAR Analytics is a modern web platform that ingests NASCAR race data (loop data, results, lap times, pit stops) from public sources, computes proprietary analytics metrics, and presents them alongside betting odds context. The goal: replace outdated tools like Lap Raptor and FRCS.pro with a clean, mobile-first experience that NASCAR fans actually want to use.

Planned domains not yet built: `odds` (deferred — see completed MVP plan). Check "Current Guarantees" and "What Does NOT Exist" below for actual state.

**Where pages live:** every page composes data from ≥2 domains, and cross-domain service imports are forbidden — so page templates and route wiring live in the app layer (`src/app/pages`, `src/app/server.ts`). Domain `ui/` folders stay reserved for future domain-specific components. Domain `runtime.ts` files carry the JSON API handlers.

## The DDD Layer Model

Each business domain is divided into fixed layers with strictly validated dependency directions.

```

### Layer Definitions

| Layer | Responsibility | Can Import From | Cannot Import From |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Types** | Pure type definitions, interfaces, enums. Zero runtime code. | `utils/` only | Config, Repo, Service, Runtime, UI |
| **Config** | Constants, thresholds, default values. No logic, no I/O. | Types, `utils/` | Repo, Service, Runtime, UI |
| **Repo** | Database access. Queries, inserts, updates. No business logic. | Types, Config, `providers/` | Service, Runtime, UI |
| **Service** | Business logic. Pure functions + orchestration. | Types, Config, Repo, `providers/` | Runtime, UI |
| **Runtime** | API route handlers. Parse request → call service → return response. | Types, Config, Service, `providers/` | UI, Repo (must go through Service) |
| **UI** | Frontend components and pages. | Types, Config | Repo, Service, Providers |

### Domain Directory Structure

```
src/domains/{domain-name}/
├── types.ts          Pure type definitions
├── config.ts         Constants, defaults, thresholds
├── repo.ts           Database queries (receives db from Providers)
├── service.ts        Business logic (or service/ directory if large)
├── runtime.ts        API route handlers
├── ui/               React/frontend components (if applicable)
└── index.ts          Barrel export
```

### Providers Pattern

```typescript
// src/providers/index.ts
export interface Providers {
  db: DatabaseClient;          // SQLite or Postgres
  nascarCdn: NascarCdnClient;  // cf.nascar.com/cacher fetcher
  oddsApi?: OddsApiClient;     // The Odds API (optional, paid)
}
```

### Cross-Domain Rules

1. Type imports across domains are allowed
2. Service-to-service calls go through Providers — not direct imports
3. Repo is never shared across domains
4. No circular dependencies between domains

## Tech Stack

| Choice | Technology | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Runtime | Bun | Fast, TypeScript-native, built-in SQLite |
| Language | TypeScript | Type safety, PAI standard |
| Database | bun:sqlite (local) → Postgres (production) | Start simple, scale later |
| HTTP | Bun.serve() | Built-in, no dependencies |
| Frontend | Server-rendered HTML (template functions) + a little vanilla JS for the two interactive pages | No framework; `bun run export` pre-renders to static files |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages (static, Direct Upload) | Free, globally cached, no server; read-only data changes only weekly |
| Styling | Hand-written CSS design tokens (src/app/style.css, spec in docs/DESIGN.md) | Replaced the original Tailwind plan — zero tooling |
| Testing | bun test | Built-in |

## Data Sources

| Source | Type | What We Get |
|--------|------|------------|
| `cf.nascar.com/cacher/{year}/{series}/{race_id}/` | Public CDN (free, no auth) | Schedules 2016+, results 2017+, lap times 2020+, pit data, live race data. Payload-verified 2026-07-05 — see [re-verification](docs/research/2026-07-05_data-sources-reverification.md) |
| `cf.nascar.com/loopstats/prod/{year}/{series}/{race_id}.json` | Public CDN (free, no auth) | Full official loop data per race (Driver Rating, quality passes, fast laps, etc.), 2019+ for Cup/Xfinity, 2018+ for Trucks. Feed is a JSON array of race objects. |
| nascaR.data (R package) | Free, CRAN | Historical results 1949-present (v3.1.0, actively maintained) |
| ~~The Odds API~~ | ❌ Does NOT cover NASCAR | Verified 2026-07-05. Odds source TBD — betting/odds domain deferred |
| rNascar23.Sdk reference | GitHub | Documents all NASCAR CDN endpoint patterns including LoopData |

## Current Guarantees

> What the system currently does reliably. Updated as features ship.

- **Data ingestion pipeline (2026-07-05)**: `bun run backfill [--series N]` / `bun run sync` ingest all three national series from the NASCAR CDN into `data/nascar.db` (SQLite). Idempotent — re-runs fetch only missing races. Rate-limited and retrying.
- **Ingested dataset — all three series (verified against known history)**: Cup (series 1), Xfinity (2), Trucks (3). Results 2017–2026, loop stats 2019–2026 (2018+ for Trucks — a bonus year), lap-by-lap times 2020–2026, cautions, race leaders. Payload-verified coverage in [the multi-series plan](docs/exec-plans/completed/2026-07-05-multi-series.md). driver_id confirmed global across series (one drivers row per person; stats separated by series_id). Sanity checks pass (Cup wins leaders 2017–2024, Xfinity 2026 Allgaier, Trucks 2024 Heim/Majeski).
- **Raw archival**: every 200 CDN response is stored verbatim under `data/raw/` with a `raw_fetches` index (URL, sha256, status) — the dataset survives any future CDN access change.
- **Track-type classification**: every 2016–2026 track across all three series classified (superspeedway/intermediate/short/road/dirt), including Atlanta's 2022 reprofile via season override; zero unknown types after the Xfinity/Truck track audit.
- **Architecture tests**: layer dependency rules are enforced by `bun test` (tests/architecture.test.ts).
- **Computed analytics (2026-07-05)**: `bun run compute` rebuilds `driver_season_stats`, `driver_track_type_stats`, `driver_form` (trailing-6-race form), and `race_metric_standouts` (per-race adjPE + Closer residuals for the recap) from points races (`race_type_id = 1` + the race-5580 override). Includes two proprietary metrics — Adjusted Pass Efficiency and Closer Score, both residuals vs. league-average baselines per running-position bucket. Verified against known history (season wins leaders 2017–2024, SVG road stats, Elliott 2023 injury season).
- **Drivers domain (2026-07-05)**: driver summaries, race logs, id/name lookup (`driver --name "..."` CLI), an identity-integrity check, and a cross-series career record (`driverCareer`). CDN driver_id verified stable across 2017–2026 — no alias table needed.
- **Cross-series career pages (2026-07-05)**: `/driver/{id}` (un-prefixed, like `/race/{id}`, since driver_id is global) shows a driver's whole record across Cup + Xfinity + Trucks on one page — grand totals, a per-series breakdown linking to each series' deep profile, and a season × series timeline matrix (starts + wins per season per series). Reached via a "Full career across series →" link on each series profile. Powered entirely by the drivers domain (one GROUP BY over points races, folded by the pure `summariseSeries`), plus `/api/driver/:id/career`.
- **Web app (2026-07-05)**: `bun run serve` (default port 3000) serves the mobile-first dark UI — home, driver index/profiles, race pages with loop insights, head-to-head compare, track-type explorer, and a proprietary-metrics leaderboard — plus JSON API routes (`/api/drivers`, `/api/drivers/:id`, `/api/drivers/:id/stats`, `/api/standings/:season`, `/api/tracks`, `/api/metrics`). All reads hit precomputed tables; measured page renders < 60ms. Look & feel per [the design mockup](docs/design-docs/2026-07-05-phase3-ui-mockup.html).
- **Proprietary-metric leaderboards (2026-07-05)**: `/metrics` (per series, new nav tab) ranks the current season's loop-data regulars — drivers who ran ≥ 50% of the season's max loop-race count (`METRIC_LEADER_MIN_LOOP_SHARE`) — by Adjusted Pass Efficiency and Closer Score, with a plain-English methodology explainer. Driver profiles show each metric's rank/percentile within that field; the home page carries a "Beyond the Box Score" card linking in. Ranking is pure/unit-tested (`rankByMetric`, `qualifiedRegulars`); no new metric math — this exposes the values already in `driver_season_stats`.
- **Weekly race recap (2026-07-05)**: `/recap` (each series' latest completed race) and `/recap/{raceId}` (un-prefixed, race_id is global) — an auto-generated post-race page composing four sections: result summary (winner + podium), "What the Loop Data Saw" (per-race adjPE + Closer standouts from `race_metric_standouts`), "Championship Picture" (points-standings movement vs. the prior race with a per-series cut line, `PLAYOFF_CUT_BY_SERIES`), and form-vs-result driver callouts. New Recap nav tab; the Home "Last Race" card links in; `/api/recap/:id`. All analytics is pure/unit-tested (`computeRaceStandouts`, `computeStandingsMovement`, `pickFormCallouts`, `regularSeasonField`, `playoffStandings`) reading precomputed tables; regenerated by the standard sync → compute → export chain. The "Championship Picture" is a **season-phase-aware playoff model** (`playoffPicture`): the regular season shows the real win-and-in field (race winners in the top 30 locked, remaining spots by points, with the cut line + bubble); the playoffs show the round (16→12→8→4, per `PLAYOFF_FORMAT_BY_SERIES`) with race-winner auto-advance and eliminations. Phase is derived from the last-N races of the season schedule. Approximations (waivers, exact reset totals, ties) are logged in the tech-debt tracker.
- **Series switching (2026-07-05)**: a Cup/Xfinity/Trucks segmented switcher (top-level nav axis, under the app bar). Series lives in the URL **path** (`/`, `/xfinity`, `/trucks`) so each series is its own static file; threaded through every page and internal link. A race page (`/race/{id}`, un-prefixed) derives its series from the race itself.
- **Automated weekly refresh (2026-07-05; worker bake wired 2026-07-18)**: `bun run refresh` — one portable, runner-agnostic command that backfills + computes all three series, exports, **regenerates the live Worker's baked artifacts** (`worker/baselines.ts` always — it reads the just-exported `dist/data/baselines-*.json`; `worker/track-strategy.ts` via `bun run calibrate`, which self-gates on raw pit-archive coverage so a CI run without `data/raw/` keeps the committed bake instead of baking garbage), and deploys **both** the Pages site and the `looplab-live` Worker (both deploys self-gate on `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; `--no-deploy` skips both). Scheduled by `.github/workflows/weekly-refresh.yml` (Mondays 12:00 UTC + manual dispatch), which caches the DB across runs so the weekly run is incremental and a cold cache self-heals to full history. Env-configurable (`NASCAR_DATA_DIR`, `NASCAR_PAGES_PROJECT`) so the same command can later run in a Cloudflare Container with the DB in R2. See [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md).
- **Static export + deployment (2026-07-05)**: `bun run export` pre-renders the whole site to `dist/` (~2,400 pages) using the same `render.ts` as the dev server, plus client JSON for the two interactive pages. Deployed to **Cloudflare Pages** via Direct Upload (`bunx wrangler pages deploy dist`) — the ~284MB DB stays local, only static output ships. Compare + track explorer render client-side from `dist/data/*.json`. See [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md).
- **Live in — deployed on two hosts (2026-07-05)**: the static site is live and public on **Cloudflare Pages** (`looplab-arh.pages.dev`, project `looplab`, wrangler account `nhorton@fabricationis.com`) and on **Vercel** (`looplab-murex.vercel.app`, project `looplab`). Same `dist/` build serves either; Cloudflare additionally honors `dist/_headers` cache rules.
- **Live race companion — Phases 1–3 LIVE (2026-07-05)**: the pure, Workers-safe `live` domain computes a normalized snapshot, live proprietary-metric estimates (live pass efficiency + adjusted residual vs. per-bucket baselines, a closing-laps Closer estimate), race alerts (`deriveAlerts`), a pit-cycle model, and — from a rolling per-lap **history** — segbar trends, movers, battles, field-leader and tire-falloff derivations. The **`looplab-live` Cloudflare Worker** (`worker/`, at **[looplab-live.nhorton.workers.dev](https://looplab-live.nhorton.workers.dev)**) runs a `LiveCoordinator` **Durable Object** as the single upstream poller (per series via `?series=`; 5s live / 60s idle / stops after 15 min unwatched), enriches the payload against **baked baselines**, keeps the history, fetches the schedule for the idle "Next Up", and serves `GET /api/live`, `/api/live/status`, and a self-contained `GET /` page. The **main site** now has a `/live` page (`client/live.js`, per series) with the layered board (tap-to-drill), a Loop Rating ★ sort, Race Overview, Strategy, and My Driver sub-tabs, plus a permanent Live nav tab (🔴 dot when live) and a home LIVE banner — **live on Cloudflare Pages ([looplab-arh.pages.dev/live](https://looplab-arh.pages.dev/live))**, validated against the eero 400 green-flag feed. Deploy: `cd worker && bunx wrangler deploy` + `bun run export && bunx wrangler pages deploy dist`. See [the plan](docs/exec-plans/active/2026-07-05-live-race-companion.md).
- Known data holes are documented in [the re-verification doc](docs/research/2026-07-05_data-sources-reverification.md) (2025 YellaWood 500 results; exhibition heat races).

## What Does NOT Exist Here

> Honest list of gaps. Must be kept updated.

- No cross-series *statistical* comparison (e.g. normalizing a Cup season against an Xfinity season side by side) — the career page unifies a driver's Cup+Xfinity+Truck record, but the analytics/compare/tracks views still each stay within one series
- The weekly refresh is automated (`.github/workflows/weekly-refresh.yml` → `bun run refresh`, Mondays 12:00 UTC); what's NOT automated is the deploy leg *until* the two Cloudflare secrets are added — before then the CI builds + artifacts `dist/` but skips the upload
- The main-site Live page (`/live`, `client/live.js`) reads the live Worker **cross-origin** — it depends on `looplab-live.nhorton.workers.dev` being up; if the Worker is down the page shows its connecting/idle state rather than site data
- The **Vercel mirror** (`looplab-murex.vercel.app`) may lag the Cloudflare deploy — the `/live` page shipped to **Cloudflare Pages** (`looplab-arh.pages.dev`); a Vercel redeploy was pending (transient upload error) at last update
- Live proprietary metrics are **estimates from live loop counters**, not the authoritative post-race `loopstats/prod` values; the DO does not yet swap to the official numbers after the checkered flag. (Baked-bake staleness is fixed as of 2026-07-18 — `bun run refresh` regenerates + redeploys the Worker bakes)
- The DO stops polling after ~15 min with no `/api/live` traffic, so alert diffs can jump across a gap when it restarts (no cron keep-warm) — fine while testers keep a tab open, revisit for unattended coverage
- The live **Strategy** tab is now **calibrated + deployed** (2026-07-06): per-track (with track-type fallback) **typical green run** + a **tire-severity tier** from the pit-discontinuity method, baked into `worker/track-strategy.ts` per series and shown honestly (tire narrative suppressed at low-deg draft tracks). A physical fuel *capacity* is deliberately **not** modeled — it isn't cleanly recoverable from history, so `lapsToTypicalPit` is a behavioral pit-cadence estimate, not a fuel gauge. **Held-out backtested** (`bun run backtest`, train <2022 / test 2022): per-track pit-cadence prediction is 60% lower MAE than the flat baseline (6.0 vs 15.0 laps; ±10 laps for 86% of held-out stints) — see [the results](docs/research/2026-07-06_strategy-backtest.md). The bake regenerates + redeploys with `bun run refresh` (2026-07-18) — but only where the raw pit archives exist (locally); CI keeps the committed bake. See [the plan](docs/exec-plans/completed/2026-07-06-strategy-model-calibration.md)
- No odds integration (deferred — see exec plan)
- No user authentication (deliberately out of MVP scope)
- Not yet running on Cloudflare-native infra — the refresh command is portable (runs in a Cloudflare Container later with the DB in R2), but today the scheduler is GitHub Actions, not a Cloudflare Cron Worker
